# NasaAPI
Enjoy the space voyage I have created.
This NasaAPI is an iOS app that displays daily images, and searched up images from our universe. While keeping in mind a minimal, and user-friendly design. The app was born from a strong desire to learn more about space, and software development. 
Here you'll be able to search any image that NASA has taken over the last couple decades. 
You can even check out the apollo 11 landing on the moon!
